# Drupal8-cordova-app
A headless mobile and web app

This cordova app is a template to setup cross-platform mobile apps styled to look and feel like their 
repspective native platforms. Ie, the app will look and feel like a native iOS app when deployed to 
iphone, same for android.

Currently, you can register user accounts, login, list nodes from a view, view/edit complete nodes.

Native look UI provided by OnsenUI (https://onsen.io/)
Drupal 8 Rest integration using jDrupal module.

As the app does not currently require any mobile specific functionality such as gesture contol etc, it can even be deployed 
as a headless web-app. 

If you require cross-platform mobile apps connected to a Drupal backend, contact:
